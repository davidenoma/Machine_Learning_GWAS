# Machine_Learning_GWAS
Traditional machine learning algorithms on some genotype and phenotype files


. The research goal of this study is to model, evaluate and compare the power of linear models to predict the phenotype given the genotype. 
The models which will be compared against each other include the polygenetic linear model, L1 (LASSO) regularization and L2 (Ridge) regularization.
